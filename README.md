About the Project
Digital Mumma is a web platform designed to bridge the gap in communication between parents and children. In today's fast-paced world, misinformation and lack of proper guidance can lead to confusion and isolation. Our platform provides accurate, problem-solving information to help users address concerns related to health, mental health, parenting, and growing-age challenges.
